          A university canteen is a dining facility located on a university
          campus that provides meals and refreshments to students, faculty, and
          staff. The university canteen doesnâ€™t only provide food but also
          wonderful memories. It serves as a convenient and accessible place for
          members of the university community to have meals, snacks, and
          beverages during the day.
